Implement 3 stacks using a single list:

class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.list = []

    def pop(self, stack_number):
        pass

    def push(self, item, stack_number):
        pass
"""


class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.list = []

        self.stack_markers = [(0,0), (0,0), (0,0)]

    def pop(self, stack_number):
        pass


    def push(self, item, stack_number):
        pass
